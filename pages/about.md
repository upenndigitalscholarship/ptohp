# About the Philadelphia Trans Oral History Project

The Philadelphia Trans Oral History Project (PTOHP) preserves and makes publicly available the stories of trans and gender-nonconforming people connected to Philadelphia.We have an intersectional and abolitionist perspective that centers trans community and stories in the face of racial capitalism and cissexism.

PTOHP places an emphasis on stories that are circulated in community, but not in the dominant narrative and especially welcomes the contributions of trans elders. By bringing trans folks into conversation we hope to counter forms of alienation and isolation, and aim to make trans history more accessible.
